                        <h1>About S4A</h1>
                        <p>S4A is a Scratch modification that supports simple programming of the Arduino open source hardware platform. It provides new blocks for managing sensors and actuators connected to Arduino. There is also a sensor report board similar to the PicoBoard one.</p>
						<p>It has been created to attract people to the programming world. The goal is also to provide a high level interface to Arduino programmers with functionalities such as interacting with a set of boards through user events.</p>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                        <h2>The interface</h2>
                        <img src="img/shot01.png"/>
						<br/>
						<small><em>An S4A program to control a light-sensor Theremin, with record and playback capabilities</em></small>
						<p>Arduino objects offer blocks for the basic microcontroller functionalities, analog and digital writes and reads, and also for higher level ones. You can find blocks to manage standard and continuous rotation servomotors:</p>
						<p><img src="img/blocks.png"></p>
                        <p>In S4A, an Arduino board is represented by a special kind of sprite. The Arduino sprite will automatically find the usb port where the board is connected.</p>
						<p>It is possible to connect to multiple boards at the same time by just adding a new Arduino sprite.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
						<h2>Technical details</h2>
						<h3>Protocol</h3>
						<p>S4A interacts with Arduino by sending the actuator states and receiving sensor states every 75 ms, therefore the pulse width needs to be greater than this time period. The data exchange follows the PicoBoard protocol and needs a specific program (firmware) to be installed in the board. Please refer to the <a href="#" onclick="slideTo('#downloads')">Downloads</a> section for further instructions on how to do so.</p>
						<h3>Supported boards</h3>
						<p>S4A works with Arduino Diecimila, Duemilanove and Uno. Other boards haven't been tested, but they may also work.</p> 
						<h3>Connectivity</h3>
						<p>Components have to be connected in a particular way. S4A allows for 6 analog inputs (analog pins), 2 digital inputs (digital pins 2 and 3), 3 analog outputs (digital pins 5, 6 and 9), 3 digital outputs (pins 10, 11 and 13) and 4 special outputs to connect Parallax continuous rotation servomotors (digital pins 4, 7, 8 and 12).</p>
						<p>You can manage a board wirelessly by attaching an RF module to it, such as Xbee.</p>
						<p>S4A allows you to control as many boards as USB ports you have.</p>
						<h3>Compatibility</h3>
						<p>S4A is backwards compatible with Scratch, so you can open Scratch projects in it. However, you won't be able to share your projects on the Scratch community website because doing so goes against the Scratch terms of use.</p>
						<p>Using a PicoBoard along with an Arduino board is also supported.</p>

                    <h3>Hardware? Child's Play!</h3>
                    <p>Scratch for Arduino (S4A) is a modified version of Scratch, ready to interact with Arduino boards. It was developed in 2010 by the Citilab Smalltalk Team and it has been used since by many people in a lot of differents projects around the world.</p>

					<p>Our main purpose was to provide an easy way to interact with the real world by taking advantage of the ease of use of Scratch.</p>
