                        <h1>About S4A</h1>
                        <p>S4A is a <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> modification that allows for simple programming of the <a target="_blank" href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> open source hardware platform. It provides new blocks for managing sensors and actuators connected to <a target="_blank" href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>. There is also a sensors report board similar to the PicoBoard one.</p>
						<p>The main aim of the project is attracting people to the programming world. The goal is also to provide a high level interface to <a href="http://arduino.cc" target="_blank">Arduino</a> programmers with functionalities such as interacting with a set of boards through user events.</p>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                        <h2>The interface</h2>
                        <p>
							<img src="img/shot01.png"/>
							<small><em>An S4A program to control a light-sensor Theremin, with record and playback capabilities</em></small>
						</p>
						<p>Arduino objects offer blocks for the basic microcontroller functionalities, analog and digital writes and reads, and also for higher level ones. You can find blocks to manage standard and continuous rotation servomotors:</p>
						<p><img src="img/blocks.png"></p>
                        <p>In S4A, an <a target="_blank" href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> board is represented by a special kind of sprite. The Arduino sprite will automatically find the usb port where the board is connected.</p>
						<p>It is possible to connect to multiple boards at the same time by just adding a new Arduino sprite.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
						<h2>Technical details</h2>
						<h3>Supported boards</h3>
						<p>S4A works with Arduino Diecimila, Duemilanove and Uno. Other boards haven't been tested, but they may also work.</p> 
						<h3>Connectivity</h3>
						<p>Components have to be connected in a particular way. S4A allows for 6 analog inputs (analog pins), 2 digital inputs (digital pins 2 and 3), 3 analog outputs (digital pins 5, 6 and 9), 3 digital outputs (pins 10, 11 and 13) and 4 special outputs to connect Parallax continuous rotation servomotors (digital pins 4, 7, 8 and 12).</p>
						<p>You can manage a board wirelessly by attaching an RF module to it, such as Xbee.</p>
						<p>S4A allows you to control as many boards as USB ports you have.</p>
						<h3>Compatibility</h3>
						<p>S4A is backwards compatible with <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, so you can open <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> projects in it. However, you won't be able to share your projects on the <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> community website because doing so goes against the <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> terms of use.</p>
						<p>Take in account that this compatibility doesn't work both ways, so you won't be able to open an S4A project from within the original <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.</p>
						<p>Using a PicoBoard along with an <a target="_blank" href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> board is also supported.</p>
						<h3>Protocol</h3>
						<p>S4A interacts with <a target="_blank" href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> by sending the actuator states and receiving sensor states every 75 ms, therefore the pulse width needs to be greater than this time period. The data exchange follows the PicoBoard protocol and needs a specific program (firmware) to be installed in the board. Please refer to the <a onclick="slideTo('#downloads')">Downloads</a> section for further instructions on how to do so.</p>

                    <h3>Hardware? Child's Play!</h3>
                    <p>Scratch for Arduino (S4A) is a modified version of <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, ready to interact with <a target="_blank" href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> boards. It was developed in 2010 by the <a target="_blank" href="http://citilab.eu">Citilab</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://world.st">Smalltalk</a> Team and it has been used since by many people in a lot of differents projects around the world.</p>
					<p>Our main purpose was to provide an easy way to interact with the real world by taking advantage of the ease of use of <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Hi Scratch for Arduino!</h2>
						<p>We have developed a simple Android application that can communicate with S4A through HTTP by means of the remote sensors protocol in <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. You can download it <a href="downloads/hi-s4a.apk">here</a> or by scanning the QR code below:</p>
						<p><img src="img/hi-s4a-qr.png"/></p>
						<p>To use it, follow the instructions below:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>In S4A, enable remote sensors (right click on any "Sensors" block)</li>
							<li>In HiS4A (Android), type the local network IP of the PC where S4A is running (you can find that out through Edit &gt; Show IP address), plus the prefix (only needed if you are connecting from more than one Android client)</li>
							<li>The buttons correspond to messages and the touchpad and slider to remote sensors <br/><img src="img/shot02.jpg"/></li>
						</ul>
						<em><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Both S4A as HiS4A must be connected to the same local network!</em>
                    </section>
					<section>
						<h2>HTTP API</h2>
						<p>The Android application uses a very simple protocol we developed on top of the <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> HTTP message protocol, so it is also possible to interact to S4A from a browser or any other network enabled application.</p>
						<p>You will first need to enable the remote sensors option in S4A (right click on any "Sensors" block).</p>
						<h3>Message Specification</h3>
						<p>Broadcast a message:<br/>
						<strong>http://[IP]:42001/broadcast=[message-name]</strong></p>
						<p>Send the value of a remote sensor (for instance, the client's accelerometer, mouse position, etc):<br/>
						<strong>http://[IP]:42001/sensor-update=[sensor-name]=[value]</strong></p>
						<p>Update an S4A variable:<br/>
						<strong>http://[IP]:42001/vars-update=[variable-name]=[value]</strong></p>
					</section>
       				<section>
						<h2>Test web application</h2>
						<p>If you want to see the HTTP API in action, you can do so from our test webapp:</p>
						<p><a href="android/index.html" target="_blank">Hi S4A! from the Web</a></p>
						<p>Using the example web application:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>S4A variables whose name starts with a plus sign (i.e. +playerName) are visible and modifiable from the web client</li>
							<li>S4A variables whose name starts with a minus sign (i.e. -playerScore) are only visible (not modifiable) from the web client</li>
							<li>S4A variables whose name doesn't start ether with a minus or plus sign are not visible from the web client</li>
							<li>S4A messages whose name starts with a plus sign (i.e. +startGame) are visible from the web client</li>
							<li>S4A messages whose name doesn't start with a plus sign are not visible from the web client</li>

						<h2>For Developers</h2>
						<p>S4A is free software distributed under an <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT</a> license.</p>
						<p>Since <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is actually a <a target="_blank" href="http://squeak.org">Squeak</a> Smalltalk image, all of its code is actually shipped with the final user version itself. To access it, just shift + left click on the S4A "File" menu and select "Exit User Mode". You're now in front of a classic <a target="_blank" href="http://squeak.org">Squeak</a> 2.8 image, and have access to a Browser, Workspace and all tools you're used to.</p>
						<p>However, in the final user version some code has been compiled and you'll be missing several variable and message argument names, which is why we are also providing you with a clean source code image for developers, downloadable here:</p>

He enrolled to his first programming course in 1975, when computers where still programmed by means of punch cards.</p>
						<p>His main work in <a target="_blank" href="http://citilab.eu">Citilab</a> has been related to the field of training in two areas: teaching programming with <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, especially to children, and teaching computer skills to early adult citizens.</p>
